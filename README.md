# 👋 Hi, I'm Anushka

🎓 **ECE (Honors) + Canfield Business Honors @ UT Austin**  
📅 **Graduating May 2027**  
💡 **Engineer · Builder · Strategist**

I'm a **hands-on engineer** who loves creating real systems — from firmware running on microcontrollers to analog/digital circuits powering hardware. I’ve built end-to-end projects across **embedded systems**, **power electronics**, and **computer architecture**, with a habit of turning ambitious ideas into working prototypes.

At **Texas Convergent**, I serve as a **Product Management Team Lead**, where I guide a 15-member engineering team and translate client needs into clear technical roadmaps and system architectures.

I'm currently exploring projects in **VLSI**, **cybersecurity**, and **data science**, blending my engineering depth with business strategy.
